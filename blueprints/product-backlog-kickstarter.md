| PDF Upload    | `UploadPage`, `UploaderBloc`    | AI Pipeline, Deck Svc | S3 bucket, `uploads` tbl | `mutation uploadMaterial()` | GPU node‑pool, Argo WF            | S3 mock, E2E cypress |

---

## 5 CROSS‑CUTTING STORIES (NFR)

* **Performance** – *Flashcards load in < 200 ms (p95).*
* **Security** – *All JWTs verified against Auth JWKS; refresh‑token rotation implemented.*
* **Scalability** – *Autoscale Deck Svc pods up to 50 replicas under 70 % CPU.*

Each is written as an INVEST‑compliant story with tests hooked into k6 and zap‑baselines.

---

## 6 INTEGRATION & THIRD‑PARTY STORIES

*Canvas LMS import, Stripe billing, FCM/APNs notifications* – full details in CSV.

---

## 7 MOBILE‑SPECIFIC STORIES

*Offline sync, iOS widgets, Android adaptive icons, PWA desktop installer* – mapped to Flutter tasks and platform channels.

---

## 8 ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS STORIES

*Student heat‑map, educator weak‑topic cloud, real‑time cohort drop‑off*.

---

## 9 GAMIFICATION & ENGAGEMENT STORIES

*Streak keeper, XP algorithm, weekly leagues, social share sheet*.

---

## 10 ADMINISTRATIVE & OPERATIONAL STORIES

*Bulk SIS import, Prometheus alert rules, GitOps rollback button.*

---

## 11 STORY DEPENDENCIES & SEQUENCING (Critical Path extract)

```text
Auth ✔ → Upload ✔ → AI Generation ✔ → Review ✔ → Learning UI ✔ → Analytics
```

Parallel lanes: *Gamification* can start once *Learning UI* API events exist; *Real‑time Analytics* waits on *Kafka* provisioning.

---

## 12 KANBAN BOARD STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS

* **Epic Board** – swim‑lanes = Phase; columns = Backlog / In Progress / Review / Done.
* **Sprint Board** – swim‑lanes = Micro‑service (Auth, Deck, AI, Frontend, Platform).
* **Bug Board** – columns triaged by severity.
* **Infra Board** – Environments, CI/CD, Observability.

### How to use this pack

1. **Import CSV/JSON** into your tracker (map fields to Summary, Description, Story Points, Components).
2. Split oversized stories (>13 SP) during refinement; each remains INVEST‑compliant.
3. Populate the **dependency matrix** in your planning tool to visualise the critical path.
4. Assign each squad a swim‑lane; WIP limit = 5.
5. Track Epic burn‑down against quarterly OKRs.

> This backlog fully aligns with the previously approved architecture and system‑design specification, ensuring traceability from business goal → epic → user story → code.
